# Node 1

## Specs:
- 240GB SSD
- 16GB RAM
- i5 6th Gen

## Software:
- Proxmox Hypervisor
- Ubuntu Server 24.04.1 LTS
- K3S

## Why Proxmox?
I decided to go with Proxmox over a bare metal Kubernetes configuration because I needed to virtualize OPNsense. It will also allow me to play with more virtual hsots. Hopefully, as I get my hands on more gear, I can add more services as I see fit.
