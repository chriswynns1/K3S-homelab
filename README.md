# K3S-homelab
I'm documenting everything I do to make my very own Kubernetes homelab.

## Services
- Wireguard
- OPNsense
- Llama w/ DeepSeek model
- piHole
- tbd...

## Infrastructure
- Dell Optiplex Mini Tower (16GB RAM, i5 6th gen + however many spare SSDs I have laying around)
- Rooted Crhomebook
- 5 port TP-Link Gigabit Switch
- Pis, SBCs, Thin Clients, and any low-power nodes I can get my hands on

# TODO:
- root chromebook to install linux on it
- install 2nd network card in main server
- configure k3s on main server + node
- router on main server?
